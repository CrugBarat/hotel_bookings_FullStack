# Hotel Booking

A full stack Hotel Booking app built using:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Front-end Web Framework**: Vue

**Back-end Web Framework**: Express

**Db**: MongoDb

**API Client**: Insomnia

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

The app can add a booking to a booking list. The booking list can be dynamically searched. The list items can be updated or deleted. The app uses RESTful routes to add, delete and update bookings in the Db.  

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

Build a system to allow a hotel to manage bookings. There should be a form to allow the hotel to add the following information for each booking:

- Guest Name
- Guest Email Address
- Checked in status

Bookings should be stored in a MongoDB via an JSON API in Express.

**MVP**

- Hotel managers should be able to view a list of all bookings
- Hotel managers should be able to add a new booking, which should update the page without the page being refreshed
- Hotel managers should be able to delete bookings

**Extensions**

- Don’t allow a booking to be submitted to the API unless both the name and email address are present

**Advanced Extensions**

- Allow the hotel manager to update the “checked in” status of the booking
